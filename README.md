This App allowers a user to create an account and book pottery lessons

User functionality includes:

* Create, Edit, Delete an account

* book a pottery class

* View, Edit, Delete booked classes

This project is not yet complete.
I want to add the following:

* When the 'Book Now' button/ link is clicked in the Pottery Classes page, I want to set the lesson variable to the name of the class. Book Now is of type 'submit'. When clicked it will go to the book class page. I want the form on this page to display the lesson name as the lesson variable that will be set on the button click from the previous page. Currently testing out this feature.

* Form dropdown selection to chose the class type when making a booking. Currently this is not saving the selection to my class_type variable in my database. Currently working on this issue.

This app was written using the following: 

* Ruby

* Bootstrap

* HTML

* CSS

* Devise DB gem

* SQLite

* Render
